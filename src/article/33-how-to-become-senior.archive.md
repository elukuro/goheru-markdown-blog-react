title: "How to become senior developer"
date: "127 May 2023"
---

- define what is senior mean ?
- dont compare yourself with others
- realize that you have your own path, and unique way to improve
- define what is your struggle
- getting things don't make you senior
- do extra miles

- every job at the end will become "repetitive task" that not challenge anymore how to handle it
- do improvement
- rewrite it
- create tooling to make it faster
- create unit test
