<!-- - define what is senior mean ?
- dont compare yourself with others
- realize that you have your own path, and unique way to improve
- define what is your struggle
- getting things don't make you senior
- do extra miles

- every job at the end will become "repetitive task" that not challenge anymore how to handle it
- do improvement
- rewrite it
- create tooling to make it faster
- create unit test -->

oftentimes, you will bored with your day to day job, because your long spint project has been done and only need some feature here and there. small bugfix or maybe just fixing some typos.
